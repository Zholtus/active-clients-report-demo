# Active Clients Report (Demo Version)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simulated version of a real-life daily "Active Clients" report, developed in a corporate banking environment. The goal of the report is to analyze client profitability and activity to support strategic decision-making.

⚠️ **Note:** All data used in this repository is synthetic and anonymized. Table and field names have been changed for confidentiality.

## 🏆 Key Achievement – Active Clients Report
This project is a demo version of a real-life report developed in a corporate banking environment.

The original report, created in Bereke Bank, helped identify active and profitable clients, track their financial behavior, and visualize key client activity metrics on a daily basis. It was a core analytical tool used by the Corporate Clients Department to make strategic decisions.

**Key impacts of the real project:**
- Improved client segmentation and retention strategy
- Supported the discontinuation of underperforming products
- Increased engagement with high-value clients
- Full automation reduced reporting time and manual work

All logic and automation (SQL, Tableau dashboards, and VBA scripts) were fully developed and optimized by the author.
